# iOS Intelligent Task Creation Fix

## Problem Summary
The intelligent task creation feature was failing because the iOS app was attempting to create tasks twice:

1. **First Creation**: When calling `intelligentCreateTask`, the backend API already creates the task in the database
2. **Second Creation**: The app then tried to create the same task again using `createTask`, which failed

## Root Cause
The `/api/tasks/intelligent-create` endpoint:
- Creates the task in the database using `storage.createTask()`
- Returns the created task with all fields populated (including `id`, `createdAt`, etc.)

The iOS app was then trying to POST this complete task object to `/api/tasks`, which expects only the fields defined in `insertTaskSchema` (excluding `id`, `createdAt`, `completedAt`).

## Solution
Updated `SmartTaskCreateView.swift` to:

1. **Skip the redundant creation**: Since the task is already created by the intelligent API, we just show success
2. **Send notifications**: Post notifications to update the tasks list
3. **Update UI text**: Changed button text to "确认并完成" to reflect that the task is already created

## Code Changes

### SmartTaskCreateView.swift
```swift
// Before: Tried to create the task again
_ = try await withLoading {
    try await self.apiService.createTask(task)
}

// After: Just show success and notify
print("✅ Task already created by intelligent API with ID: \(task.id)")
self.showSuccessAlert = true

// Notify that tasks need refresh
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .taskCreated, object: task)
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .tasksNeedRefresh, object: nil)
```

### Added Notification Support
- Created `NotificationNames.swift` with standard notification names
- Updated `TasksViewModel` to listen for `tasksNeedRefresh` notification
- Fixed notification handling to use `notification.object` instead of `userInfo`

## How It Works Now
1. User enters task description
2. App calls `/api/tasks/intelligent-create` which creates and returns the task
3. App shows the task preview
4. When user confirms, app just shows success (no second creation)
5. Notifications update the tasks list automatically

## Backend Behavior
The `/api/tasks/intelligent-create` endpoint:
- Analyzes the task description using AI (or fallback rules)
- Creates the task in the database
- Returns the complete task object with all fields iOS expects

This is the correct behavior - the intelligent creation is a one-step process that both analyzes AND creates the task.
