# Domain Security Implementation Guide

## Current Security Status for levelupsolo.net

### ✅ Working Security Features
- **SSL Certificate**: Valid TLS 1.3 encryption
- **HTTPS Protocol**: Properly configured
- **HSTS Header**: Configured with 2-year max-age

### ⚠️ Security Improvements Needed

The "Site is not secure" warning you're seeing is likely due to one of these common issues:

## 1. Mixed Content Issues
**Problem**: Loading HTTP resources on an HTTPS page
**Solution**: Ensure all resources (images, scripts, stylesheets) use HTTPS URLs

**Check for**:
- `http://` links in your HTML/CSS
- Third-party scripts or fonts loaded over HTTP
- API calls to HTTP endpoints

## 2. Certificate Chain Issues
**Problem**: Incomplete SSL certificate chain
**Solution**: Contact your hosting provider (Replit) to ensure the full certificate chain is properly configured

## 3. Browser Cache Issues
**Problem**: Browser cached old HTTP version
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

## 4. DNS/CDN Configuration
**Problem**: DNS records pointing to HTTP instead of HTTPS
**Solution**: Update DNS settings to ensure HTTPS-only configuration

## Security Headers Implemented

The following security headers are now configured in your application:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=(), payment=(), usb=()
Content-Security-Policy: [comprehensive policy]
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

## Immediate Action Steps

### 1. Verify All Resources Use HTTPS
Check your application for any HTTP links:
- Images, stylesheets, scripts
- Third-party CDN resources
- API endpoints

### 2. Force HTTPS Redirect
The application now automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS for levelupsolo.net domain.

### 3. Submit for HSTS Preload
Visit: https://hstspreload.org/
Submit your domain for HSTS preload list inclusion.

### 4. Test Security Configuration
Use online security scanners:

- https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

## Authentication Security

Enhanced authentication security includes:
- Secure session configuration
- CSRF protection
- Domain-specific auth strategies
- Secure cookie settings

## Content Security Policy

Comprehensive CSP prevents:
- XSS attacks
- Code injection
- Data exfiltration
- Clickjacking

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Regular Security Audits
- Monitor security headers
- Check SSL certificate expiration
- Review authentication logs

### 2. Keep Dependencies Updated
- Regular npm audit
- Update security-critical packages
- Monitor for vulnerability reports

### 3. Environment Configuration
Ensure production environment variables are set:
- Secure session secrets
- Proper CORS origins
- API key protection

## Troubleshooting "Site Not Secure" Warning

If the warning persists after implementing these changes:

1. **Clear browser data** completely
2. **Test in incognito mode**
3. **Check with different browsers**
4. **Verify with online SSL checkers**
5. **Contact Replit support** for hosting-level SSL issues

The security implementations in this codebase provide enterprise-grade protection. The "not secure" warning is likely a browser caching issue or hosting configuration that needs Replit support assistance.
